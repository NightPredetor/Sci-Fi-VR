**Soul Stone**<br>
The Soul Stone is the main object that allows a lot of functionality. By default the Soul Stone is not liftable. It has to be touched to bring the UI which will allow you to gain the power to lift it.
It will come to life when its powers are unlocked.

**The Canvas**

The Canvas contains the way to unlock the true power of the Soul Stone. Gain the power through the Instruments Tab.

**The Door**

The door blocks the way to the Container Room. It will only unlock when you gain the power to lift the Soul Stone. Lose the power and the door will slam shut.

**Containers**

The 3 containers feature different interactions with the Soul Stone. Beware of Container C though.
